## WHY
- On Binance, users can only retrieve 3 months of trade history at a time.
- Binance client doesn't display some basic statistics that can inform trading decisions. 
- Fancy performance tracking tools are not **free**. 

## Features
- Fetch user spot wallet information
- Fetch user account deposit and withdrawal history
- Estimate user trades in BTC and USDT price
- Calculate average buy/sell price of each coin in BTC and USDT
